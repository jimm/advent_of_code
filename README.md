# Advent of Code

I like solving these in multiple languages. For the first few years it was
Elixir. Now it's Python, Elixir, Common Lisp, or whatever other language I
choose.

## Running the Solutions

The bash script `aoc` in this directory will run any solution or test for
any year. Run `aoc -h` to get help.

The `makeup` command used by the `-m` flag is a script of mine that finds
the nearest Makefile, Rakefile, or similar build file and runs the
corresponding make tool.
