# Advent of Code

I like solving these in Elixir.

## Running the challenges

There is one subdirectory under `lib` for each year. The days' solutions are
all in that directory. To run a day's puzzle, which usually comes in two
parts, open up an IEx console and run the lines that are commented out at
the end of the file. For example,

    $ iex -S mix
    iex> Y2016.Day08.run1

In progress.

## 2015

http://adventofcode.com/2015

The solutions to the first 19 days in 2015 are in a strange state. I
re-registered in 2016 using different account info, so the puzzle inputs are
different. In 2015, days 1-11 are re-solved with new inputs. Days beyond
that aren't, mostly because I'm having trouble getting Posion to work.
