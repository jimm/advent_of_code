# Advent of Code

I like solving these in multiple languages. For the first few years it was
Elixir. Now it's Python, Elixir, Common Lisp, or whatever other language I
choose.

Apparently, in 2017 I used a different login so my results don't show in my
main account. The solutions are in lisp/y2017.
