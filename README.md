I like solving these in Erlang.

## Running the challenges

There is one subdirectory for each year. The days' solutions. are all in
that directory To run a day's puzzle, which usually comes in two parts, open
up an IEx console and run the function directly.

    $ iex -S mix
    iex> Y2016.Day08.run1
